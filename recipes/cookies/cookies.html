            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 350F. Cream the butter in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or in a stand mixer until it is soft. Add the sugar <br>
            and keep beating until the mixture is light and fluffy. Sift in the flour and add the optional ingredients, if you're using them. <br>
             Bring the mixture together with your hands in a figure-of-eight motion until it forms a dough. You can freeze the dough at this point.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place them slightly apart from each other on a baking sheet (you donâ€™t need to butter <br>
            or line it). Flatten the balls a little with the palm of your hand and bake them in the oven for around 10-12 mins until they are <br>
            golden brown and slightly firm on top. Leave the cookies on a cooling rack for around 15 mins before serving.</li>        
        </ol>
